  - "WD12-1"   # CSS Media Queries (Dark mode/Reduced motion)
  - "WD14-2"   # Efficient JS APIs
  - "WD16-3"   # Dependency audit
  - "HIS02-1"  # Cache-Control headers implementation
  - "HIS03-1"  # Gzip/Brotli compression

exclusions:
  - "WSG-4.1 (Hosting)" # Usually a DevOps/Infra decision, FE can only advocate.
  - "WSG-3.1 (Goals)"   # Strategic decision, not implementation task.
  - "WSG-2.x (UX)"      # Responsibility of Design team, FE implements the spec.

expected_outcomes:
  - "Learner can demonstrate a 20% reduction in KB size of a sample page."
  - "Learner can implement dark-mode toggles that respect system preferences."
  - "Learner can audit and remove 3 unused dependencies from a project."
```

## Role: UX Designer

**ARRM Scope**: Interaction Design, Information Architecture, User Journey.

  - "WSG-2.4"  # Minimize non-essential content/journeys
  - "WSG-2.5"  # Ensure navigation is well-structured
  - "WSG-2.6"  # Design to assist not distract
  - "WSG-2.7"  # Avoid manipulative/deceptive patterns
  - "WSG-2.9"  # Use a design system
  - "WSG-2.15" # Provide accessible, minimal web forms

included_star_techniques:
  - "UX02-1"   # Quantitative user needs research
  - "UX04-1"   # Measure interaction cost (click depth)
  - "UX04-5"   # Remove non-user initiated pop-ups
  - "UX05-1"   # Accessible navigation structure
  - "UX05-2"   # Sitemap/Wayfinding
  - "UX07-1"   # Audit for Dark Patterns
  - "UX09-1"   # Implement Design System
  - "UX15-1"   # Minimize form fields

exclusions:
  - "WSG-3.x (Code)"    # Implementation detail.
  - "WSG-4.x (Hosting)" # Infrastructure detail.
  - "WSG-2.13 (Typo)"   # Visual Design specific (unless combined role).

expected_outcomes:
  - "Learner can map a user journey and identify 2 removable steps."
  - "Learner can audit a UI for dark patterns."
  - "Learner can restructure a navigation menu to reduce search time."
```
