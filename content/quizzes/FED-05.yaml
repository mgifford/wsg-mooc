questions:
  - scenario: >
      You inspect the HTTP headers for your main JavaScript bundle and see `Content-Encoding` is missing. The file is 500KB.
    choices:
      - text: "This is fine. Broadband connections are fast enough."
        correct: false
      - text: "Enable Gzip or Brotli compression on the server. This could reduce the transfer size by 60-70%."
        correct: true
      - text: "Split the file into two 250KB files."
        correct: false
      - text: "Rename the file to .txt so it transfers faster."
        correct: false
    explanation: >
      Text-based assets (HTML, CSS, JS) are highly compressible. Serving them "raw" is negligent waste of bandwidth. 
      Compression is the single most effective infrastructure-level optimization.

  - scenario: >
      You update your site logo (an image) once every 3 years. Currently, the browser re-downloads it on every single visit.
    choices:
      - text: "Leave it. Images are cached by default."
        correct: false
      - text: "Configure `Cache-Control` headers (e.g., `max-age=31536000`) so returning users load it from their disk, not the network."
        correct: true
      - text: "Embed the image as base64 in the HTML."
        correct: false
      - text: "Make the image smaller so the download creates less impact."
        correct: false
    explanation: >
      The most sustainable request is the one that never hits the network. Proper caching strategies ensure that unchanging assets 
      are stored locally (zero carbon cost) rather than fetched repeatedly.
