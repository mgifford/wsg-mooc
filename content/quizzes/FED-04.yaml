      A user visits your site with their OS set to "Dark Mode". Your site currently has a bright white background.
    choices:
      - text: "Do nothing. The brand guidelines clearly state the website background must be white."
        correct: false
      - text: "Use a CSS media query to invert the colors (dark background, light text), respecting the user's choice and saving energy on OLED screens."
        correct: true
      - text: "Show a popup asking them to turn off Dark Mode."
        correct: false
      - text: "Invert only the images, but keep the background white."
        correct: false
    explanation: >

  - scenario: >
      Your homepage features a large, looping video background. A user arrives with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` enabled.
    choices:
      - text: "Play the video anyway. It's the core emotional hook of the page."
        correct: false
      - text: "Pause the video automatically. Show a static poster image instead."
        correct: true
      - text: "Slow the video down to 50% speed."
        correct: false
      - text: "Play the video but blur it slightly."
        correct: false
    explanation: >
      Reduced motion isn't just about vestibular disorders; it's a signal that the user wants a calmer, less processor-intensive experience. 
      Stopping auto-play saves significant battery life.
