questions:
  - scenario: >
      You are designing the "Delete Account" flow. A stakeholder argues that making it easy will increase churn. 
      They suggest adding a requirement to call customer support to finalize the deletion.
    choices:
      - text: "Agree, as reducing churn is the primary business metric."
        correct: false
      - text: "Compromise by offering a 'Pause Account' option but keeping the 'Call Support' requirement for deletion."
        correct: false
      - text: "Push back, arguing that forcing a digital-only user to use an analog channel (phone) creates unnecessary friction and keeps unwanted data on servers."
        correct: true
      - text: "Implement the phone requirement but add a tool tip explaining why."
        correct: false
    explanation: >
      This is a "Roach Motel" pattern. It artificially increases the energy and time cost to leave. 
      Sustainable design allows users to manage their data lifecycle autonomously without arbitrary barriers.

  - scenario: >
      You are auditing a newsletter signup modal. The subtle text below the "Sign Up" button says "No thanks, I prefer to stay uninformed." 
      The marketing team says this increased conversion by 2%.
    choices:
      - text: "Keep it. A 2% increase in conversion justifies the tone."
        correct: false
      - text: "Change the text to a neutral 'No thanks' or 'Close'."
        correct: true
      - text: "Make the text smaller so it's less offensive but still works."
        correct: false
      - text: "Remove the close option entirely and force a click outside the modal."
        correct: false
    explanation: >
      This is "Confirmshaming". While it may boost short-term metrics, it manipulates users through guilt. 
      Sustainable UX respects the user's emotional state and intent, building long-term trust over short-term "hacks".

  - scenario: >
      An e-commerce checkout flow automatically adds "Shipping Insurance" to the cart (checked by default). 
      Users must uncheck it to opt out.
    choices:
      - text: "Leave it. It protects the user's package and increases average order value."
        correct: false
      - text: "Change it to 'Opt-in' (unchecked by default), requiring the user to actively select it if they want it."
        correct: true
      - text: "Move the checkbox to the end of the page so they see it right before paying."
        correct: false
      - text: "Add a second popup asking 'Are you sure?' if they uncheck it."
        correct: false
    explanation: >
      This is the "Sneak into Basket" or "Default Effect" pattern. Pre-checking inputs generates distinct waste—users 
      buying things they don't want, leading to potential refunds, customer service cycles, and financial waste. Intent should always be explicit.

  - scenario: >
      You notice a high number of users are accidentally enabling "Share my data with partners" because the toggle switch label 
      says "Opt-out of data sharing" but the switch is "On".
    choices:
      - text: "Add a second switch to confirm the choice."
        correct: false
      - text: "Rewrite the label to be positive and direct: 'Allow data sharing', set the switch to 'Off' by default."
        correct: true
      - text: "Change the color of the switch to red to indicate danger."
        correct: false
      - text: "Leave it, as data sharing is valuable for the business model."
        correct: false
    explanation: >
      This is "Privacy Deception" or confusing logic. Sustainable design minimizes cognitive load and unintentional data transfer. 
      Ambiguous controls lead to "data pollution"—collecting data users never meant to give.

  - scenario: >
      You observe that after "simplifying" the unsubscribe flow to a single click, the "Retention Rate" metric dropped by 5%. 
      The Head of Product wants to revert to the old 4-step process.
    choices:
      - text: "Revert immediately. Retention is the key indicator of product health."
        correct: false
      - text: "Analyze the 5% who left. If they were inactive/unhappy, argue that their departure is 'healthy pruning' that saves resources."
        correct: true
      - text: "Compliment the 4-step process with a 10% discount offer to keep them."
        correct: false
      - text: "Hide the unsubscribe button in the footer to reduce visibility."
        correct: false
    explanation: >
      High retention forced by friction is a false signal ("Captivity", not loyalty). Sustainable product management values an active, 
      engaged user base over a bloated database of users who are only there because they couldn't find the exit.

  - scenario: >
      A stakeholder asks why the team should invest 2 days in fixing a "Exit Path" (cancellation flow) that generates zero revenue.
    choices:
      - text: "'It provides feature parity with our competitors.'"
        correct: false
      - text: "'It is required by law in some regions, so it is just a compliance task.'"
        correct: false
      - text: "'Respecting the user's right to leave reduces 'revenge' costs (spam reports, negative reviews) and clears dead data from our systems.'"
        correct: true
      - text: "'It will make our designers feel better about their work.'"
        correct: false
    explanation: >
      Reframing the exit path as a sustainability and reputation shield is effective. A user trapped in a system generates negative value 
      (support tickets, spam complaints) and wasted storage cost (dead accounts).
