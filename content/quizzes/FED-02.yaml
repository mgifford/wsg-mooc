questions:
  - scenario: >
      A team member wants to install a 30KB library called `left-pad-super` just to add padding to a string in one component.
    choices:
      - text: "Install it. Developer productivity is more important than file size."
        correct: false
      - text: "Reject the installation. Write a simple 3-line utility function to handle the padding natively."
        correct: true
      - text: "Install it, but use a CDN link instead of bundling it."
        correct: false
      - text: "Install a larger library that includes padding plus 50 other features, just in case."
        correct: false
    explanation: >
      Importing an entire library for a trivial task is "Dependency Bloat". Sustainable development prefers native language features 
      or small custom functions over heavy external code liabilities.

  - scenario: >
      Your bundle analyzer shows that you are including the entire `lodash` library (70KB), but you are only using the `debounce` function.
    choices:
      - text: "Keep it. Caching handles the file size problem."
        correct: false
      - text: "Switch to importing only the specific function (e.g., `import debounce from 'lodash/debounce'`) or use a lighter alternative."
        correct: true
      - text: "Rewrite the entire application to avoid using debounce."
        correct: false
      - text: "Wrap the library in a lazy-load promise so it loads later."
        correct: false
    explanation: >
      "Tree-shaking" or specific imports ensure you only ship the code you actually use. Shipping dead code wastes bandwidth 
      and CPU time on parsing bytes that never run.
