    title: "The Friction Audit"
    description: >
      Select a live digital service (your own or a public one) and map the "Exit Path" for a user trying to unsubscribe, downgrade, or delete their account. 
      Document every distinct interaction required to achieve the goal.
    inputs:
      - "Target URL (e.g., Use a real newsletter unsubscribe link or account settings page)"
      - "Screen capture tool or Flow mapping tool"
    measurement_method: "Manual (Interaction Cost Count)"
    evidence:
      - "Screenshots of every modal, confirm dialog, and email verification step."
      - "Final Count: Total Clicks + Total Key Presses + Total Page Loads."
      - "Assessment: Is this >3x the effort of the Sign-Up process?"

    title: "The Cost of Captivity"
    description: >
      Calculate the environmental impact of a "Default Opt-in" pattern. 
      Assume a specific dark pattern (e.g., pre-checked newsletter box) causes 10% of users to receive unwanted emails.
      Calculate the data waste generated by this pattern over one year.
    inputs:
      - "Estimated Monthly Active Users (use a hypothetical 10,000 if data unavailable)"
      - "Frequency of unwanted artifact (e.g., 4 emails/month)"
      - "Size of unwanted artifact (e.g., 50KB per email)"
    measurement_method: "Manual Calculation / CO2.js logic"
    evidence:
      - "Formula: (Users x 10% x Frequency x Size x 12 months) = Total Data Waste (GB)."
      - "Carbon Equivalent: Convert Total Data Waste to kgCO2e using 0.81 kWh/GB (standard estimate)."
