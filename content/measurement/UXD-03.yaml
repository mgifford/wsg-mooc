# Measurement Tool Recommendations for Lesson UXD-03
# Context: Removing Toxic Patterns (Dark Patterns, Friction)

id: UXD-03-M
lesson_id: UXD-03

recommendations:
  primary_tool:
    name: "CO2.js (via Manual Calculation)"
    type: "Calculation Library / Formula"
    applicability: "High"
    valid_uses:
      - "Calculating the carbon impact of 'Ghost Data' (e.g., unwanted emails sent to 10k users)."
      - "Quantifying the aggregate waste of 10 extra seconds of screen time across a user base."
    limitations:
      - "Requires manual input estimates (Email size, Send frequency)."
      - "Not a 'point-and-click' scanner."

  secondary_tool:
    name: "Chrome DevTools (Network Tab)"
    type: "Browser Utility"
    applicability: "Medium"
    valid_uses:
      - "Summing the total payload of the 'Exit Path' (e.g., measuring the combined weight of the 4 pages required to unsubscribe)."
    limitations:
      - "Does not measure server-side processing cost."

  excluded_tools:
    - name: "Ecograder / Website Carbon"
      reason: "False Positive Risk"
      explanation: >
        These tools measure the performance of a single URL. A deceptively designed cancellation page might be very lightweight (getting an 'A' grade), 
        masking the fact that the user was forced to visit 5 such pages to complete a simple task. 
        They measure *efficiency*, not *intent* or *friction*.

  learner_warning: >
    "⚠️ WARNING: Do not use single-page scanners (like Website Carbon) to validate this lesson. 
    A 'Green' score on a page that traps users is a failure of measurement. 
    For UX, you must measure the *Process Cost* (Sum of all steps), not the *Page Cost*."
