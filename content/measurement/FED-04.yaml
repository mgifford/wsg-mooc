id: FED-04-M
lesson_id: FED-04

recommendations:
  primary_tool:
    name: "Chrome DevTools (Rendering -> Emulate CSS Media Features)"
    type: "Browser Utility"
    applicability: "High"
    valid_uses:
      - "Simulating 'prefers-color-scheme: dark'."
      - "Simulating 'prefers-reduced-motion: reduce'."
    limitations:
      - "Simulation only; doesn't measure actual device power draw."

  secondary_tool:
    name: "Android/OLED Manual Check"
    type: "Physical Test"
    applicability: "Low (Requires Hardware)"
    valid_uses:
      - "Observing if 'black' pixels truly turn off (emit no light)."
    limitations:
      - "Hard to quantify without external meters."

  learner_warning: >
    "⚠️ Automated tools check if the *code* exists (media query present), not if the design is actually usable or energy-efficient in that mode."
