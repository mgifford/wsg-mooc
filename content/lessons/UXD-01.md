# Validating User Intent

## The Decision
"Does this feature solve a real problem, or are we building it because we *can*?"

## Why It Matters
The most sustainable product is the one you don't build. Countless development hours, server cycles, and storage bytes are wasted on features that users ignore. As a UX Designer, you are the first line of defense against "feature bloat." By ruthlessly validating intent before a single line of code is written, you prevent the creation of digital waste. This isn't just about business ROI; it's about respecting the planetary resources required to build and host software.

## Common Failure Modes
*   **"Solution Looking for a Problem"**: Designing a cool interaction or feature and then trying to justify why users need it.
*   **"Hippo Design"**: Implementing features solely because the Highest Paid Person's Opinion demanded it, without data.
*   **"Feature Parity"**: Copying a competitor's feature without understanding if *your* users actually need it.

## "Do This Now" Checklist
1.  **The "5 Whys"**: For the current feature request, ask "Why?" five times until you reach the root user need. If you can't find one, flag it.
2.  **Paper Prototype**: Test the concept with a sketch or wireframe before any high-fidelity design work begins. Kill the idea cheap.
3.  **Data Audit**: Look at analytics for existing features. Identify one rarely used section and purpose a plan to "sunset" (remove) it.
4.  **User Interviews**: Talk to 3 real users. Ask them about their biggest pain points. If the new feature doesn't address one of them, pause.

## Measurement Options
*   **Adoption Rate**: If the feature is built, what percentage of users actually engage with it?
*   **Feedback Loops**: How quickly can you invalidate a hypothesis? (Days vs. Weeks).

## Reflection Prompt
"If we cancelled this feature today, would any user actually complain?"
