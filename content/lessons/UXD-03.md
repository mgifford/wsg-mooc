# Removing Toxic Patterns

## The Decision
"Am I helping the user make a choice, or am I tricking them into making *my* choice?"

## Why It Matters
"Dark Patterns" (or Deceptive Design) exploit cognitive biases to force users into actions they didn't intend—like subscribing to newsletters, buying insurance, or sharing contacts. Beyond the ethical failure, these patterns create waste. They generate unwanted emails (spam), trigger accidental downloads, and force users to spend time (energy) undoing mistakes. Honest design is sustainable design because it respects the user's intent and resources.

## Common Failure Modes
*   **"Roach Motel"**: Easy to sign up, impossible to cancel.
*   **"Confirmshaming"**: "No, I don't want to save money" button text to guilt users.
*   **"Sneak into Basket"**: Automatically adding items or insurance to a cart.
*   **"Privacy Deception"**: Confusing toggle switches where "On" means "Opt-out" (or vice versa).

## "Do This Now" Checklist
1.  **Unsubscribe Test**: Try to delete an account or unsubscribe on your own platform. If it takes more than 3 clicks, redesign it.
2.  **Toggle Clarity**: Review all settings. Ensure "On" implies a positive action or addition, and labels are unambiguous.
3.  **Neutral Language**: Rewrite CTA (Call to Action) / Cancel buttons to be neutral and descriptive ("Subscribe" / "No Thanks"), not manipulative.
4.  **Cart Audit**: verify that the cart total only reflects items the user explicitly clicked "Add" on.

## Measurement Options
*   **Support Tickets**: Monitor complaints related to "I didn't mean to buy this" or "How do I cancel?".
*   **Retention vs. Resentment**: High retention forced by difficult cancellation is not loyalty; it's captivity.

## Reflection Prompt
"Would I be comfortable explaining this interaction flow to my grandmother?"
