# Findability & SEO

## The Decision
"Does the user know exactly what this page is about before they click?"

## Why It Matters
A user clicking the "Back" button is a failure of sustainability. It means they loaded a page, realized it was wrong, and have to load another one. This "pogo-sticking" wastes data and time. Good SEO isn't just about ranking; it's about providing accurate "Information Scent." Clear titles and descriptions ensure that when a user clicks, they find what they expected, making their journey efficient.

## Common Failure Modes
*   **"Clickbait"**: Titles that over-promise and under-deliver.
*   **"Duplicate Content"**: Multiple pages competing for the same topic, confusing the user and search engines.
*   **"Vague Links"**: "Click here" or "Read more" links that give no context about the destination.

## "Do This Now" Checklist
1.  **Unique Title**: Ensure the `<title>` tag describes the specific content of the page, not just the company name.
2.  **Meta Description**: Write a 160-character summary that acts as an "ad" for the content, helping users decide if it's relevant.
3.  **Descriptive Headings**: Use H1/H2s that outline the content structure. Can a user understand the page just by reading headings?
4.  **Link Text**: Rewrite "Click here" to "Download the 2024 Annual Report".

## Measurement Options
*   **Bounce Rate**: High bounce rates (on non-informational queries) indicate a mismatch between expectation and reality.
*   **CTR (Click Through Rate)**: Are users choosing your result?

## Reflection Prompt
"If this page appeared in search results without my branding, would I know what it was?"
