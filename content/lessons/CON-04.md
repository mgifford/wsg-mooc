# Content Lifecycle

## The Decision
"When will this content expire, and what happens when it does?"

## Why It Matters
The web is littered with digital trash—outdated news, expired offers, and obsolete documentation. This "ROT" (Redundant, Obsolete, Trivial) clutters search results, confuses users, and wastes server storage and backup energy. Sustainable content strategy includes an exit plan. Creating content is easy; deleting it is hard but necessary. A smaller, fresher site is more efficient and trustworthy.

## Common Failure Modes
*   **"Publish and Pray"**: Launching a page without ever looking at it again.
*   **"Broken Links"**: Linking to external resources that 404'd years ago.
*   **"Ghost Ships"**: Entire microsites from campaigns that ended 5 years ago, still live and vulnerable to security hacks.

## "Do This Now" Checklist
1.  **Sunset Date**: Every time you publish, set a reminder (3 months, 6 months, 1 year) to review it.
2.  **ROT Audit**: Scan your site for pages with <10 visits in the last year. Archive or delete them.
3.  **Redirect Strategy**: If you delete a page, where should the traffic go? Set up a 301 redirect to the next best relevant page.
4.  **PDF Purge**: scan for old PDF files. They are notoriously inaccessible and hard to update. Convert the vital ones to HTML pages and delete the rest.

## Measurement Options
*   **Page Count**: Track the total number of live pages over time (aim for stability or reduction, not infinite growth).
*   **404 Errors**: Monitor how often users hit dead ends.

## Reflection Prompt
"Is this page a historical artifact, or is it currently useful?"
