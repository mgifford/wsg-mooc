# Writing for Clarity

## The Decision
"Can I say this in half the words?"

## Why It Matters
Reading requires energy—both biological (brain usage) and electrical (screen time). Long, meandering text keeps users on the screen longer, scrolling more, and loading more data. "Plain Language" isn't just an accessibility requirement; it's a sustainability one. By writing clearly and concisely, you respect the user's time and reduce the cognitive and electrical load of your content.

## Common Failure Modes
*   **"Corporate Speak"**: Using jargon like "leveraging synergies" instead of "working together."
*   **"Wall of Text"**: Paragraphs that are 10+ lines long, intimidating users.
*   **"Burying the Lede"**: Hiding the main point at the bottom of the article.

## "Do This Now" Checklist
1.  **Front-Load**: Put the most important information in the first sentence of the paragraph.
2.  **Plain Language**: Run your text through a tool like [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/). Aim for a Grade 8 reading level or lower.
3.  **Active Voice**: Change "Mistakes were made by the team" (Passive) to "The team made mistakes" (Active). Shorter and stronger.
4.  **Bullet Points**: Break any list of 3+ items into a bulleted list for scanning.

## Measurement Options
*   **Reading Time**: Estimated time to read the article (Word Count / 200).
*   **Readability Score**: Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level.

## Reflection Prompt
"Am I writing to sound smart, or to be understood?"
