# Streamlining Navigation

## The Decision
"How fast can I get the user to their goal, so they can stop using my product?"

## Why It Matters
A user spending 10 minutes confusedly clicking through menus isn't "high engagement"—it's frustration and energy waste. Every page load involves data transfer and device processing. Efficient navigation minimizes the "interaction cost" (mental effort + clicks) required to complete a task. Your goal is to be a helpful concierge, not a labyrinth. The faster users succeed, the less energy they consume.

## Common Failure Modes
*   **"Mystery Meat Navigation"**: Icons or labels that require hovering or clicking to understand what they do.
*   **"Deep Hierarchies"**: Burying critical content 4+ levels deep in a menu structure.
*   **"Broken Search"**: A search bar that returns irrelevant results, forcing the user to manually browse.
*   **"Pogo-sticking"**: Users clicking into a category, realizing it's wrong, going back, and trying another.

## "Do This Now" Checklist
1.  **Card Sort**: Run a quick card sorting exercise (even with colleagues) to verify your menu categories match mental models.
2.  **Breadcrumbs**: Ensure clear "You are here" trails (Breadcrumbs) on deep pages so users can jump back up one level instantly.
3.  **Label Audit**: Rename vague menu items like "Solutions" or "Resources" to be descriptive (e.g., "Developer API", "Case Studies").
4.  **Search Check**: Test your site search with the 5 most common user queries. Do the right pages come up first?

## Measurement Options
*   **Task Time**: Measure the time (seconds) it takes a user to find a specific piece of information.
*   **Click Depth**: What is the average number of clicks to reach content pages from the home page?

## Reflection Prompt
"Am I designing for 'time on site' metrics, or for user success?"
