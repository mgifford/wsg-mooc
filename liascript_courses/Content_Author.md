## CON-01: Writing for Clarity

## The Decision
"Can I say this in half the words?"

## Why It Matters
Reading requires energy—both biological (brain usage) and electrical (screen time). Long, meandering text keeps users on the screen longer, scrolling more, and loading more data. "Plain Language" isn't just an accessibility requirement; it's a sustainability one. By writing clearly and concisely, you respect the user's time and reduce the cognitive and electrical load of your content.

## Common Failure Modes
*   **"Corporate Speak"**: Using jargon like "leveraging synergies" instead of "working together."
*   **"Wall of Text"**: Paragraphs that are 10+ lines long, intimidating users.
*   **"Burying the Lede"**: Hiding the main point at the bottom of the article.

## "Do This Now" Checklist
1.  **Front-Load**: Put the most important information in the first sentence of the paragraph.
2.  **Plain Language**: Run your text through a tool like [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/). Aim for a Grade 8 reading level or lower.
3.  **Active Voice**: Change "Mistakes were made by the team" (Passive) to "The team made mistakes" (Active). Shorter and stronger.
4.  **Bullet Points**: Break any list of 3+ items into a bulleted list for scanning.

## Measurement Options
*   **Reading Time**: Estimated time to read the article (Word Count / 200).
*   **Readability Score**: Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level.

## Reflection Prompt
"Am I writing to sound smart, or to be understood?"

### ✓ Knowledge Check

Review what you've learned. Multiple attempts encouraged!

**Question 1:** Who benefits from Grade 8 level writing?

[ ] Only children.
[x] Everyone, including experts.

> **Explanation**: Experts prefer plain language because it saves them time.

**Question 2:** How does concise content help the environment?

[ ] Less data to store and transfer.
[ ] Less time spent reading (screen on time).
[x] Both of the above.

> **Explanation**: Cognitive load and server load are both reduced.


---

### 🛠 Assignment

1. Note the initial grade.
1. Simplify sentences and remove adverbs.
1. Note the final grade.

## CON-02: Findability & SEO

## The Decision
"Does the user know exactly what this page is about before they click?"

## Why It Matters
A user clicking the "Back" button is a failure of sustainability. It means they loaded a page, realized it was wrong, and have to load another one. This "pogo-sticking" wastes data and time. Good SEO isn't just about ranking; it's about providing accurate "Information Scent." Clear titles and descriptions ensure that when a user clicks, they find what they expected, making their journey efficient.

## Common Failure Modes
*   **"Clickbait"**: Titles that over-promise and under-deliver.
*   **"Duplicate Content"**: Multiple pages competing for the same topic, confusing the user and search engines.
*   **"Vague Links"**: "Click here" or "Read more" links that give no context about the destination.

## "Do This Now" Checklist
1.  **Unique Title**: Ensure the `<title>` tag describes the specific content of the page, not just the company name.
2.  **Meta Description**: Write a 160-character summary that acts as an "ad" for the content, helping users decide if it's relevant.
3.  **Descriptive Headings**: Use H1/H2s that outline the content structure. Can a user understand the page just by reading headings?
4.  **Link Text**: Rewrite "Click here" to "Download the 2024 Annual Report".

## Measurement Options
*   **Bounce Rate**: High bounce rates (on non-informational queries) indicate a mismatch between expectation and reality.
*   **CTR (Click Through Rate)**: Are users choosing your result?

## Reflection Prompt
"If this page appeared in search results without my branding, would I know what it was?"

## CON-03: Accessible Media

## The Decision
"If I couldn't see this image or listen to this video, would I still understand the content?"

## Why It Matters
Images and videos are often the primary storytelling elements, but for users with visual or auditory impairments (or those in loud cafes, or with slow data), they are invisible. Text alternatives (Alt Text, Transcripts, Captions) are redundant safeguards. They ensure the message survives even if the media fails to load or cannot be perceived. This redundancy is the core of robust, sustainable content.

## Common Failure Modes
*   **"Image of Text"**: Important announcements locked inside a JPG banner with no Alt text.
*   **"Missing Captions"**: Video content with no subtitles, excluding deaf users and those with sound off.
*   **"Lazy Alt"**: "image123.jpg" or "Logo" as the alt text.

## "Do This Now" Checklist
1.  **Alt Text**: Describe the *function* of the image, not just the appearance. If it's decorative, mark it as such (alt="").
2.  **Transcripts**: Provide a full text transcript for any audio/video content. This is also great for SEO and low-bandwidth users.
3.  **Captions**: Verify that auto-generated captions are accurate (they often fail on names and technical terms).
4.  **No Auto-Play Audio**: Ensure audio never plays automatically—it disrupts screen readers and annoys everyone.

## Measurement Options
*   **Accessibility Audit**: Tools like [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) or [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) can valid the presence (but not quality) of Alt text.
*   **Transcript Downloads**: Track how often users access the text version of media.

## Reflection Prompt
"Am I assuming everyone accesses the web exactly like I do?"

### ✓ Knowledge Check

Review what you've learned. Multiple attempts encouraged!

**Question 1:** When an image is purely decorative, what should the alt text be?

[ ] alt='decorative'
[ ] Leave it out completely.
[x] alt='' (empty string)

> **Explanation**: An empty attribute tells screen readers to ignore it.

**Question 2:** Can auto-generated captions be used as-is?

[ ] Yes, AI is perfect.
[x] No, they must be reviewed for accuracy.

> **Explanation**: Inaccurate captions fail the WCAG requirement.


---

### 🛠 Assignment

**Goal**: Open your media library or a recent article. Find 5 images. Write the alt text that conveys the *information*, not just the visual description. If the image has no info, mark it as decorative.

#### Steps

1. Select images.
1. Contextualize: Why is this image here?
1. Write the text alternative.
1. Test: If I remove the image and put the text here, is the meaning lost?

#### Deliverable

5 images with proposed alt text.


---

### 💭 Reflection

Take a moment to reflect on what you learned.

**Does every image conveying meaning have a text alternative?**

[[___]]

**I have provided captions (not just auto-generated) for all video.**

[[___]]

**I have written alt text that describes the *function* of the image, not just the appearance.**

[[___]]

**If an image fails to load (low bandwidth), does the text alternative save the experience?**

[[___]]

**Why are text transcripts 'greener' than video?**

[[___]]

**How does searching video content depend on text alternatives?**

[[___]]

#### Your Commitment

"I will provide text alternatives for every piece of non-text content I publish."

## CON-04: Content Lifecycle

## The Decision
"When will this content expire, and what happens when it does?"

## Why It Matters
The web is littered with digital trash—outdated news, expired offers, and obsolete documentation. This "ROT" (Redundant, Obsolete, Trivial) clutters search results, confuses users, and wastes server storage and backup energy. Sustainable content strategy includes an exit plan. Creating content is easy; deleting it is hard but necessary. A smaller, fresher site is more efficient and trustworthy.

## Common Failure Modes
*   **"Publish and Pray"**: Launching a page without ever looking at it again.
*   **"Broken Links"**: Linking to external resources that 404'd years ago.
*   **"Ghost Ships"**: Entire microsites from campaigns that ended 5 years ago, still live and vulnerable to security hacks.

## "Do This Now" Checklist
1.  **Sunset Date**: Every time you publish, set a reminder (3 months, 6 months, 1 year) to review it.
2.  **ROT Audit**: Scan your site for pages with <10 visits in the last year. Archive or delete them.
3.  **Redirect Strategy**: If you delete a page, where should the traffic go? Set up a 301 redirect to the next best relevant page.
4.  **PDF Purge**: scan for old PDF files. They are notoriously inaccessible and hard to update. Convert the vital ones to HTML pages and delete the rest.

## Measurement Options
*   **Page Count**: Track the total number of live pages over time (aim for stability or reduction, not infinite growth).
*   **404 Errors**: Monitor how often users hit dead ends.

## Reflection Prompt
"Is this page a historical artifact, or is it currently useful?"
